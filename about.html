            <h1 class="headings">My Home Country: <i>South Africa</i></h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in South Africa. The past 19 years of my life in South Africa made me the person I
                am today. It will forever be my home. South Africa is known as a <b><span style="color: purple;">Rainbow
                        Nation</span></b>,
                which means that we are a nation filled with many people from different cultural backgrounds. We are
                also known for our
                beautiful nature, which attracts tourists from all over the world. Our diversity, unity and nature
                makes me proudly South African. Although South Africa will forever be in my heart, I decided to take a
                big step to change my life
                completely...I packed my bags and moved to Switzerland.

            <h1 class="headings">My Work: <i>Switzerland</i></h1>
            <p>The 8th of March 2025. The first day of new chapter. I have always wondered about life beyond South
                Africa. I wanted to explore and
                experience the european life. It was not an easy decision to leave my family, friends and my home
                behind, but I craved to try new
                things and discover who I am. This was the best decision ever. To achieve this I applied to become an au
                pair. I worked for 6 months
                in Zürich. I looked after two amazing children, Simon (7) and Julia (10). This experience was truly
                amazing. The family gave me the
                opportunity to see popular tourist attractions, celebrate swiss holidays and learn about the culture.
                Not only did I have a new family,
                and new adventures, I also grew as a person. I become more social, confident and motivated to achieve my
                goals and dreams. The parents
                helped me become this new version, and I will forever cherish these 6 months.

            <h1 class="headings">My Studies: <i>Austria</i></h1>
            <p>Once again, I have decided to change my life and move to another country, leaving a wonderful family
                behind. I decided to study Informatics
                at the <b><span style="color: purple;">IMC Krems University of Applied Sciences</span></b>. After months
                of looking at hundreds
                of universities, I came accross this university. I immediately fell in love with the program structure
                of Informatics, the university campus
                with all it's amazing facilities, as well as the diversity of students from different cultural
                backgrounds. I started studying about a month ago,
                and to be honest, the program is not easy, however I am so happy and excited to continue learning about
                coding, computers and so much more.
                I am living in a private apartment with two other girls. they are wonderfull roomates and we work well
                toagther. The city overall is beautiful,
                quiet and peaceful. I am excited to see where this chapter takes me...
